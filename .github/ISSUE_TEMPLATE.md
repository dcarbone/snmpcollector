For faster fixes and/or improvements would be nice if we can work with a simulation snapshot, plese follow this commands and attach the `sim_data_<DATE>_#<issue>.tar.gz` file to the issue.

```
# git clone https://github.com/etingof/snmpsim.git`
# cd snmpsim
# sudo python3 setup.py install
# mkdir sim_data
# snmpsim-record-commands --use-getbulk --getbulk-repetitions 50 --protocol-version 2c --community <your_comunity> --agent-udpv4-endpoint=<your_device>:161 --output-file=./sim_data/device_data
# tar zcvf sim_data_<DATE>_#<issue>.tar.gz sim_data
```
NOTE: this command could take some time, please be patient
